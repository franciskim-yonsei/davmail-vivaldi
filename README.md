# DavMail 6.5.1 fork made for Vivaldi integration

A number of changes have been made to `src/java/davmail/imap/ImapConnection.java` and `src/java/davmail/exchange/MessageLoadThread.java`, mostly guided by LLM suggestions as well as trial-and-error.

Only tested in two Windows 11 PCs; absolutely no performance guarantee can be made.
